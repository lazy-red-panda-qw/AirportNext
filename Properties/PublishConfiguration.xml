# My First Mod - Still Learning and Evolving!

- Currently contains **basic** markings.
- More content will be added in future updates!

# Easily Detail Your Airport Ground!

This mod adds new decals and netlane markings to the game, making it much easier to decorate your airport surfaces.

## With this mod, you can:

- Add intricate details to your airport taxiways, runways, and aprons.
- Make your airport look highly realistic and professional.

## Currently Included:

- **Complete sets** of basic taxiway markings: Letters (A-Z), "OUTBOUND" text, standard holding points.
- Basic taxiway centerline markings (standard and enhanced styles, including an **ILS Critical Area Boundary** marking).
- Runway markings: Full sets of runway numbers (**0-9**) and suffix letters (**L, R, C**) in different sizes (**Small, Medium, Large**)
- Straight lines in various colors (e.g., white, yellow) and widths (thin, medium, thick) - perfect for creating touchdown zones or other custom markings.
- **Complete sets** of white letter and number decals (A-Z, 0-9) for adding detailed labels and information.

## Important Notes:

- This mod focuses on ground detailing, providing **decals and painted line markings only** (no 3D objects or functional changes).
- To accommodate airports of all sizes and diverse player creativity, the included elements are **basic building blocks**. They are not pre-configured "standard parts" but rather versatile markings and textures, giving you maximum freedom for DIY customization!

## Future Plans:

- Add additional letter sets in **yellow** and **black** color schemes for greater visual variety.
- Add more essential markings: Runway shoulders, taxiway shoulders, more kinds of direction arrows, etc.

## Ultimate Goal:

- Provide all the decals, line markings, and surface textures needed to create a **FAA-compliant** (or ICAO-standard) airport!
