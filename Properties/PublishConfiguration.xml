# This is my first mod and I'm still learning more, so:

- It contains BASIC markings currently
- I'll update more contants through the future updates

# An eazy way to detail your airport!

Add some new decals and neetlines to the game, making it much easier to decorate your airport ground.

## With this mod, you can:

- Add extra dedails to your airport ground
- Make your airport looks super real and sick

## Note:
- This mod is designed for detailing the ground, so it contains only decals and netlanes
- Considering the different sizes of players' airports and the different customisation needs of different players, the components added by this mod are not "standard parts" - more basic markings and textures to give different players more room for DIY!

## Future plan:
- Add all decals and netlines and even surfaces that you'll need to create a FAA-legal airport!
