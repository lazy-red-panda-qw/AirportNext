# AirportNext
*A CSL II decal & netlane pack for detailing your airport ground!*
## This is my first mod for CSL II so it may take longer than expected to finish, but I'll always updating it before it's fully finished!
## The reason why I posted this mod here is because that I couldn't publish it through `ModPublisher.exe`, no matter how hard I tried :(
### Currently we have:
- Full packs of basic taxiway marks (A-Z,outbound & normal)
- Basic taxiway lanes(normal & enhanced, including an ILS Critical Boundary)
- Runway markings, e.g. full pack of the numbers and L, R & C
- - Lines with different colours and thickness
### Future plan:
- More taxiway lanes, e.g. shoulders
- Airport ground surfaces
### If you have any problems or suggstions, welcome to contact me at 2929954331@qq.com, I'm all ears!
